  'In early 2022, my programming journey began when I stumbled upon something that truly piqued my interest: an online course titled "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures" on freecodecamp.com. Since then, I have been continuously advancing my knowledge in web development, achieving this by enrolling in online courses, following tutorials on YouTube, and delving into online documentation. Furthermore, commenced my formal studies at ORT University Uruguay in August 2023, pursuing a program known as "Analista en Tecnologías de la Información." In addition, I keep independently expanding my programming knowledge.',
  'I am certain that full-stack development is what I want to do. In essence, I take pleasure in the process of learning about web programming and creating functional applications or features for existing projects that truly work.',
